### About

<div style="text-align: center;">
  ![](images/bio-photo.png){.photo-circle width=150px}
</div>

👋 I am an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) broadly interested in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence and Optimization. Specifically, I am interested in interpretability, understanding generalization, and uncovering interesting mechanisms about how small and large models work under the hood. In the past, I have worked on applying AI across a wide range of scientific and social domains. 

### Awards

**LookSharp: Attention Entropy Minimization for Test-Time Adaptation** 

**Yash Mali**, Evan Shelhamer

We minimize the entropy of CLS-to-patch attention in the final layer as a novel TTA loss, encouraging the model to maintain focused attention on shifted data. We demonstrate that attention entropy minimization improves robustness on ImageNet-C. We also show that it is complementary to output entropy minimization and maintains performance on clean data.
