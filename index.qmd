### About

<div style="text-align: center;">
  ![](images/bio-photo.png){.photo-circle width=150px}
</div>

👋🏼 I am an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) interested in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence and Optimization. I have worked as a Undergraduate Researcher applying AI to many fields and as a ML engineer. I am driven by fundamental questions about what deep learning learns and how optimization shapes intelligent behavior in AI systems.

This work bridges AI and social science to address Canada's housing crisis. Supervised by [Dr. Julia Harten](https://scarp.ubc.ca/directory/julia-harten) and [Dr. Christos Thrampoulidis](https://ece.ubc.ca/christos-thrampoulidis/).

- **Unpacking AI 🎨** | **UBC Arts** (part-time) | *May 2025 – Present*

    Developing modules in existing faculty of arts courses that highlight how AI can be used in their field. For example, sequence modelling in economics or computer vision in archeology. Funded by UBC's Teaching and Learning Enhancement fund (TELF). Supervised by [Dr. Laura Nelson](https://sociology.ubc.ca/profile/laura-nelson/) and [Dr. Jonathan Graves](https://economics.ubc.ca/profile/jonathan-graves/). [More info](https://github.com/ubcecon/praxis-ubc).

- **AI and Automation Developer 🧬** | [**Lux Bio**](https://www.luxbio.ca/) (co-op) | *Sep 2024 – May 2025*

    Applied AI-based drug discovery tools like AlphaFold and ProteinMPNN to optimize sequences and 3D structures of enzymes. Revamped automation systems for bioprocess engineering, orchestrating sensors, pumps, motors, and valves.

- **Computer Vision & Automation – Undergraduate Research 🔬** | **UBC Engineering** @ [**Frostad Research Group**](https://food.chbe.ubc.ca/) (co-op) | *May 2024 – Sep 2024*

    Developed particle tracking software using an ensemble of open-source computer vision models along with a UI to correct mistakes. Automated and developed data collection software for new instruments invented by the research group. Helped with some day-to-day lab activities. Supervised by [Dr. John Frostad](https://chbe.ubc.ca/john-m-frostad/).

### Additional Experience


- **Undergrad Thesis 💾** | *Sep 2025 – Present*

    Researching how data diversity and noise affects autoregressive models learn and the kinds of solutions they find through a controlled synthetic data setting. Supervised by [Dr.Christos Thrampoulidis](https://ece.ubc.ca/christos-thrampoulidis/).

- **[UBC AI Club](https://ubcaiclub.github.io/) 🦾** | *Jan 2025 – Present*

    President: Leading initiatives to encourage student understanding and future pathways in AI and ML.

- **[UBC Uncrewed Aircraft Systems](https://ubcuas.com/) ✈️** | *Sep 2024 – Present*

    Leading the ML sub-team to explore and tune open-sourced models for object detection and tracking. This is a small piece of the puzzle on our drones that compete in two university-level autonomous drone competitions every year.

- **[UBC Biological Internet of Things](https://ubcbiot.com/) 🧬** | *May 2025 – Present*

    Automating brewing/fermentation equipment with IoT-controlled devices while also trying to make glow-in-the-dark beer using green fluorescent protein (GFP).

- **[IT Helpdesk Support](https://it.ubc.ca/) 👨‍💻** | *May 2023 – May 2024*

    Provided technical assistance to faculty, staff, and students for tech-related queries and equipment across campus.

**AttenDence: Maximizing Attention Confidence for Test-Time Adaptation** | *Graduate course project*

CPSC 532: Adaptation and Adaptive Computation | *Fall 2025*

Developed a test-time adaptation method for attention based models that minimizes the entropy of CLS-to-patch attention distributions so the model attends more confidently to relevant image regions under distribution shift. This attention-entropy minimization improves robustness to diverse corruptions on single-image test streams while preserving performance on clean data. Code and preprint coming soon!
